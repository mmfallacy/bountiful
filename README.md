> This repository contains the source code for the front-end prototype of _Bountiful_. It serves as our official submission for [HackFest 2020: Online](https://hackfest.dscadmu.org), a 48-hour hackathon organized by the Developer Student Club (DSC) Loyola.

# Bountiful
_Bountiful_ is a competitive e-commerce platform that puts customers at the forefront of every business model.

# Building from Source
The front-end prototype was developed with [Node.js v15](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v15.3.0/) using the [React framework](https://reactjs.org) for JavaScript. Instead of NPM, we used [Classic Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as our package manager.

Assuming that both Node.js and Yarn have been installed, the project can be hosted locally using the commands below:
```bash
# Clone the Git repository
git clone https://github.com/mmfallacy/bountiful.git

# Pull in project dependencies
yarn install

# Host the app locally in development mode
# at http://localhost:3000
yarn start
```

Alternatively, running `yarn build` automatically builds the project in production mode, wherein all assets are minified and optimized for deployment. The compilation can be found in the resulting `build/` folder.
